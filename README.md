Open ended machine learning project to create a LSTM-RNN that utilizes the Kaggle - Amazon  Reviews dataset.

Initial efforts will be around word prediction, but I'm considering doing classification tasks, sentiment analysis if all goes well.

IE - Are negative reviews found to be more or less useful, can I predict usefulness based on sentiment



Built with tensorflow, numpy



**TODO**
-Utilize padding | mini-batch padding | bucketing | dynamic RNNs to maintain review integrity

-Make something that works

-Add more layers

-Visualize graph

-Save state

-GRU flexible?
