Open ended machine learning project to create a LSTM-RNN that utilizes the Kaggle - Amazon Reviews dataset.

Initial efforts will be around word prediction, but I'm considering doing sentiment anaylsis if all goes well.
(Are negative reviews found to be more or less useful, can I predict usefulness based on sentiment)

TODO
-Utilize padding | mini-batch padding | bucketing | dynamic RNNs to maintain review integrity
-Make something that works
